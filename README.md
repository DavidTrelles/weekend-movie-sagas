# Project Name

Weekend Movie Sagas

## Description

The project involved a two main areas - one was creating a means so that when the image of a movie was clicked on, it took you to a page that listed details about that movie. Furthermore we needed to display the genres of that movie which required some sequel joins. Furthermore the app was in great need of additional styling.
